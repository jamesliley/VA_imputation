# VA_imputation
Development of a proposal to calibrate marginal answer probabilities in verbal autopsies by optimising accuracy of imputation.

# Overview

This is a repository containing code used in experimentation to evaluate our proposed method. 

We intend for the functions in this repository to be developed into an R package, and the pipeline to eventually accompany a paper on the method. This software is not yet ready for use. 

# Contents

Currently this repository contains several files and figures:

- ```imputation_test.R```: a pipeline to run simulations
- ```imputation_analysis.R```: code to summarise and analyse simulation results. 
- ```Package_temp```: contains code building towards an R package for this task.
- ```Working```: contains other working files not intended to be part of the package
- ```Figures```: contains figures outputted from the simulation. 

Raw simulation results are not kept in the repository due to large size.
