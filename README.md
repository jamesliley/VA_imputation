# VA_imputation
Development of a proposal to calibrate marginal answer probabilities in verbal autopsies by optimising accuracy of imputation

# Overview

This is a (currently private) repository containing code used in experimentation to evaluate our proposed method. 

We intend for the functions in this repository to be developed into an R package, and the pipeline to eventually accompany a paper on the method. 

# Contents

Currently this repository contains two files:

- ```VA_imputation_pipeline.R```: a pipeline in which the method is tested
- ```VA_imputation_functions.R```: accompanying functions.
