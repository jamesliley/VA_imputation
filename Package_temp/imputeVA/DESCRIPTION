Description: A verbal autopsy is a standardised interview with the family of a deceased person. A verbal autopsy algorithm takes such an interview and gives likely causes of death, making use of a table (called a probbase) describing how likely it is that a person with a given cause of death would answer a question in a particular way. The construction of such probbases is difficult, and we propose a method to help by assessing how well a given probbase allows missing answers in a verbal autopsy questionnaire to be imputed. This description will be updated with a link to our manuscript in due course.
